WEB AUTHORING


The proposed project aims to revamp the ggholdingsgroup.com website by developing a new PHP website with enhanced functionality and a database management system to store and retrieve information efficiently. The new website will consist of at least six pages that will offer users various features such as company information, client showcase, project portfolio, and contact submission. 
Please note that ggholdingsgroup.com is a domain purchase that will be made once the project has been vetted and completed to satisfaction.

The project will start with the development of a MySQL relational database with at least two tables, i.e., Clients and Projects, to store relevant information about the company's clients and projects. The Clients table will contain details such as client names, contact information, and other relevant data, whereas the Projects table will store information such as project names, descriptions, and status. Appropriate normalization techniques will be applied to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.

After the database is created, a new PHP website will be developed consisting of six pages, namely the Home, About Us, Services, Clients, Projects, and Contact Us pages. The Home page will provide an introduction to GG Holdings Group and showcase the company's portfolio. The About Us page will offer information about the company's history, mission, and values. The Services page will detail the services offered by GG Holdings Group, including descriptions and case studies. The Clients page will showcase the company's clients retrieved from the "Clients" table in the database, along with successful projects completed for each client. The Projects page will display a list of projects retrieved from the "Projects" table in the database, with details such as project names, descriptions, and status. Lastly, the Contact Us page will provide contact information for the company and allow users to submit inquiries or requests for quotes.

The new website will offer users various functionalities, such as learning about the company's history, mission, values, and services, viewing the company's clients and successful projects completed for each client, and gaining an understanding of the company's capabilities and expertise by viewing the project portfolio. The website will also enable users to contact the company and submit inquiries or requests for quotes easily. Additionally, the website will connect to the MySQL database to retrieve and display up-to-date and accurate information about clients and projects.

The project code will be hosted on a GitHub repository, allowing for version control, collaborative development, and easy deployment. The repository link will be provided upon request.

In conclusion, the proposed website revision for ggholdingsgroup.com aims to develop a new PHP website with enhanced functionality and a database management system to store and retrieve information efficiently. The new website will offer users various functionalities, such as company information, client showcase, project portfolio, and contact submission, and will be hosted on a GitHub repository for efficient and collaborative development.
